## UTEK 2018 Programming Solution: Team 5

### Running the solution

To run the solution, please, in the top level directory, run

`sh ./run`

To run the tester, run

`python3 tester.py`

### Visualization
Optimization algorithm in Part 3 outputs timestamped log which are plotted.
The file will have lines of the following format:
`<seconds since start (float)>|<current best key (space separtaed integers)>|<best likelihood (float)>|<testing key (as before)>|<test likelihood (float)>`
